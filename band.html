    <h1>Yoav Goren</h1>
<pre>

Yoav Goren (Hebrew: יואב גורן) is an Israeli-American musician, composer, and record producer specializing in soundtracks and trailer music for films and television series.[1] 
He was one of the founders of Immediate Music, 1 Revolution Music, and Imperativa Records.

Born in Israel, Goren was raised in New York City by an artistic family that encouraged him to study piano at a young age.
 He was influenced initially by classical composers, then by the Beatles and by film composers Ennio Morricone, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Barry.
  He began composing while studying at New York University, where he graduated with a degree in Film & Television Production.

After touring with several bands in the US as a keyboardist, Goren settled in Los Angeles, California, where he met and collaborated with Leonard Cohen on the critically acclaimed[6]
 album The Future (1992) as arranger and co-producer.

In 1993, Goren co-founded Immediate Music with fellow composer Jeffrey Fayman. From his first trailer score for Carlito’s Way in 1993 to campaigns for films 
such as Star Wars, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Avengers, X-Men, Amazing Spider-Man, and the complete Harry Potter series, Goren and Immediate 
Music have provided music to motion picture studios through both custom scoring and the Immediate Music production music library. W
ith over 6,000 trailer score placements to date, the team of Goren and Fayman are among the world's most frequently utilized composers in the motion picture advertising industry.
[10] Building upon the success of Immediate Music, Goren collaborated again with Fayman in 2010 to co-found the company 1 Revolution Music,
 which produced a production music catalog for licensed use in television programming and other media. Both Immediate Music and 1 Revolution Music were acquired by BMG Rights Management in 2017.

In 2006 Goren launched Imperativa Records, a commercial record label specializing in the music genre known as Epic Music. Notable artists and releases include Globus Music and the Trailerhead series.

Goren received an Emmy Award in 2007 for ‘Outstanding Music Composition in a Sports Program’, and a BMI Award in 2008, 
for his contribution to "The XX Olympic Winter Games: The Stories of Torino" during NBC's XX Olympic Winter Games broadcast.
 Goren was also tapped by Telemundo Deportes to compose the official theme song of Telemundo's 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP™ BROADCAST.

<hr>
Early life <br>
Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England,the second child of a working-class family. His mother Edith (née Greene; 1914–1993) was from a Welsh mining family; Fripp considers himself to be half Welsh.
 Her earnings from working at the Bournemouth Records Office allowed his father, Arthur Henry Fripp (1910-1985) to start a business as an estate agent. In 1957, at age eleven,
  Fripp received a guitar for Christmas from his parents and recalled, "Almost immediately I knew that this guitar was going to be my life".
  He then took guitar lessons from Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike; at age 11, Elvis Presley's guitarist Scotty Moore inspired Fripp to play rock, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15.
   He cited jazz musicians Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus as his musical influences during this time.
In 1961, the fifteen-year-old Fripp joined his first band, The Ravens, which also included Gordon Haskell on bass.
After they split in the following year, Fripp concentrated on his O-level studies and joined his father's firm as a junior negotiator. At this point, he intended to study estate management and, 
eventually, take over his father's business. However, at seventeen, Fripp decided to become a professional musician. He became the guitarist in the jazz outfit The Douglas Ward Trio, playing in the Chewton Glen Hotel of New Milton, 
followed by a stint in the rock and roll band The League of Gentlemen which included two former Ravens members.
In 1965, Fripp left the group to attend Bournemouth College, where he studied economics, economic history, and political history for his A-levels.
 In February 1965, Fripp went to see the Duke Ellington Orchestra, an experience which moved him deeply.
  He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at Bournemouth's Majestic Hotel (replacing future The Police guitarist Andy Summers, who had gone off to London with Zoot Money). 
  It was during this time when he met musicians that he would collaborate with in his career: John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James, and Greg Lake.
   At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxemburg where he heard the last moments of "A Day in the Life".
    "Galvanized" by the experience, he went on to listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Béla Bartók's string quartets, Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony, Jimi Hendrix's 
    Are You Experienced and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers.Many years later, Fripp would recall that "although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn't say no".
